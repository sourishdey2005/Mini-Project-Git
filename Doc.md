The AQI graph for Delhi (2020–2024) shows extreme daily fluctuations with recurring winter spikes, often reaching hazardous levels. These seasonal peaks are driven by stubble burning, temperature inversions, and festival emissions. While 2020 saw lower values due to lockdowns, pollution quickly rebounded, highlighting persistent structural air quality challenges.

The month‑over‑month AQI change highlights strong seasonal variation in Delhi’s air quality. October and November show sharp increases (over +125%), reflecting post‑monsoon crop residue burning and winter inversion effects that trap pollutants. In contrast, February, March, June–August record negative changes, indicating relative improvement due to rainfall and atmospheric dispersion. Overall, the chart underscores critical autumn–winter deterioration in AQI, while summer and monsoon periods provide temporary relief.

The number of “Severe” AQI days in Delhi fluctuates considerably across 2020–2024, reflecting episodic pollution crises. After 27 severe days in 2020, the count rose to 37 in 2021, dipped to 19 in 2022, and then surged to a peak of 44 in 2023. Although 2024 shows some reduction (35 days), the overall trajectory indicates persistent and worsening air quality stress, with 2023 standing out as the most hazardous year. This variability suggests that while meteorological factors and temporary interventions may reduce severity in certain years, structural drivers like vehicular emissions, crop residue burning, and industrial activity continue to dominate Delhi’s pollution profile.

The cumulative pollutant load shows clear seasonal concentration patterns in Delhi. Peaks in January, November, and December reflect winter stagnation and stubble burning, with PM2.5 and PM10 dominating the pollutant mix. Mid‑year months (June–August) record the lowest loads, largely due to monsoon rainfall and atmospheric cleansing. The stacked profile highlights particulate matter as the primary contributor, while gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2, NH3, CO, O3) add secondary stress. Overall, the chart emphasizes wintertime pollution crises and the relative relief provided by monsoon dispersion.
